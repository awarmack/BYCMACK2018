PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
================

Objectives
----------

Determine if gain or loss versus other boats is due to poor boat trim and course or due to bad luck.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Sources

-   YellowBrick: Position of Zubenelgenubi versus other boats
-   Boat Instrumentation: Wind, Boat Speed, and Position

### Measured Values

-   TWA: True Wind Angle \[Deg\]
-   TWS: True Wind Speed \[kts\]
-   COG: Course Over Ground \[Deg\]
-   SOG: Speed Over Ground \[kts\]
-   Position: Lat/Lon

### Derived Values

-   Optimal Boat Speed \[kts\] -- From boat polars
-   Polar Percentage \[%\]
-   Optimal Velocity to the Mark
-   VMC Percentage \[%\]

### Data Collected

The boat instrument data was collected through Expedition \[link\] running on a tablet connected to the boat through wifi.

However, the tablet could not run the entire race due to battery life. So we could not collect boat instrument data throughout the entire race.
